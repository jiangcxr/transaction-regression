# Transaction Data Regression using ARIMA

This project is the final project of the virtual internship experience provided by Kalbe Nutritionals x Rakamin Academy. The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data given using PostgreSQL, perform data visualization using Tableau, and lastly perform regression using ARIMA algorithm and clustering on the data given. However, in this repository, I will only share the SQL documentation and the jupyter notebook for the regression and clustering of the data.
